# Theorem-Prover
A resolution theorem prover for propositional logic

Works by indirect proof: Dissolves a list of propositions and conclusion into conjunctive normal form, which it attempts to resolve by generating new clauses with something akin to breadth-first-search for a contradiction.

If the conclusion is true, it will resolve.
